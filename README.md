# Cluster Validity for Big Data
This repository includes the code of our two algorithms for approximating Dunn's internal cluster validity index for big data. These algorithms have been published in the following journal. 

Rathore P., Ghafoori Z., Bezdek J. C., Palaniswami M., Leckie C. "Approximating Dunn's Cluster Validity Indices for Partitions of Big Data" in  IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (IEEE T-CYB), 2018

Code is being reviewed and will be uploaded soon.
